# A bit repetitive. I am basiscally just testing the mixing of keywords not and in

# Remember 'in' has to be on some type which is iterable

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

# Simple one-liner
3 not in a

# Print statement
print 3 not in a

# if statement
if 3 not in a:
    print 'what'

# Loop
while 3 not in a:
    print 'hello'
