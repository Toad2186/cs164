# Testing different multiple assignments in python.

# Conventional "Tuple - number assignment"
a, b = 1, 2

# Changing it up a little bit with weird size tuple and mixed assignment
c, d, e = "hello", 4, "world"

# Changing it up with some varying parenthesis
(f,g,h) = 1,2,3
(i,j,k) = (3,4,5)
l,m,n = (8,9,7)

# Print em all cause I can.
print a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h
